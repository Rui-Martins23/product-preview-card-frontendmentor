## Overview
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://rui-martins23.github.io/product-preview-card-frontendmentor/]

## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using the mobile-first approach on this project was the main challenge, as it's the first time I'm practicing this approach.

### Continued development

Definitely have to practice more this approach, as trying to render the project properly on all kinds of devices is super important.
Will spend the next times trying to get better on this aspect of web development.
